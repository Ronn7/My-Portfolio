            <p> Fortnite is a survival game where 100 players fight against each other in player versus player combat to be the last one standing. It is a fast-paced, action-packed game, not unlike The Hunger Games, where strategic thinking is a must in order to survive. There are an estimated 125 million players on Fortnite. Finalists from all over the world who qualified have flown in to New York compete for a $30 million prize pool at the FortniteWorld Cup. With over 400,000 people viewing  online, players compete at the Arthur Ashe tennis stadium for a chance to win. In July of 2019, a 16-year-old North America East player finished with 59 points and win a prize of $3 million. </p>

            <p> Fortnite Battle Royale (as well as PUBG) is inspired by the Japanese film ‘Battle Royale’, where a class of middle schooler are trapped on an isolated island and have to kill each other until there’s only one student left. The movie is based off the 1999 novel by Japanese author Koushun Takami. If it sounds a lot like the Hunger Games it’s because Suzanne Collins borrowed heavily from Battle Royale for her series. </p>
